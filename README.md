# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a project in TOP , it's about coding a game using javascript 

well , i forgot to add my files at all , no problem 
fast summary : first phase : it was weird 
                second phase : things started to get clear 
                third phase : somehow i finished , and now i'm happy that everything is working right

the only way that i can add the ability to give the user the power of choosing the number of rounds is still impossible with my knowledge and the possible solution is by use in promise and await or something like that i'm not entirely sure  , so i will discard this feature for now
